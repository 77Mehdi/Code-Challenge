ðŸ’¡ My Approach
Set up a Vite + React project

Used a folder-based architecture to keep components and logic organized

Created a custom hook to fetch API data cleanly

Applied smooth UI/UX animations and layout from ui.aceternity.com

Used conditional rendering and state to handle display logic

Focused on responsive layout and clear user feedback
